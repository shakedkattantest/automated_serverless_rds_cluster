**Key Features:**
- Developers send a JSON request (via API Gateway)
- Request is routed through SNS → SQS → Lambda
- Lambda creates a GitHub Pull Request with Terraform code
- CI/CD pipeline applies the infrastructure using Terraform
- Supports both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**, in **dev** and **prod** environments
